If your lab is using an IoT Server running in Ravello you will need to take the following actions

1/ Make sure that you have edited your hosts file and put an entry in there for the iot server
e.g.
129.146.89.93	iotserver
This is because the provisioning files produced by the IOT server embedd the name of the server in the URL

2/ Set the JVM SSL properties to use the provided truststore, this is part of the JVM run configuration (in 
Eclipse) or in the command line this comes *before* any program arguments
E.g. 
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=WioTruststore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=secret
