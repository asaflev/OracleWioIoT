The easiest way to to configure the Wio Node is via the iOS or Android apps. I
did have problems with these with iOS 12 where the Wio Link app crashes during 
the device setup process and on at least some versions of Android there are 
timing errors in the wifo config steps
If you can't get these to work then you can do the same process using the Wio
command line tools, look at their github for details

Note that the wio login process seems to have a bug in it in that it doesn't 
update the $HOME/.wio/config.json file with the email address you used for the
Wio global server account. You need to edit this file by gand and set the email 
address, if you don't then devices that you add will not
