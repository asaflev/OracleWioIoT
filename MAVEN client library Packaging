The device-library.jar file comes from Oracle, but it's not available via public Maven repositories.
So we need to add it to the local Maven repository to enable the runtime to locate it.

For this workshop we are using vewrsion 18.3.1 of the IoT server. The relevant jar files are in the project
export in the lib/jars folder.  The other dependencies (Derby and json.org) are available via Maven, but
are also in the folder for non Maven users.

To add it into the local Maven remo (Usualy in $HOME/.m2/repository) run the following command
CLEARLY YOU NEED TO ADJUST BASED ON THE ACTUAL VERSIONS, PATHNAMES ETC.

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=<group-id> \
        -DartifactId=<artifact-id> -Dversion=<version> -Dpackaging=<packaging>
    
For example

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=$HOME/Downloads/iotcs/18.3.1/csl/javase/lib/device-library.jar  -Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=com.oracle.iot.client \
        -DartifactId=device-library -Dversion=18.3.1
        
There also needs to be a dependency in the pom.xml file (that should be in place, but check the version number)

  	<dependency>
  		<groupId>com.oracle.iot.client</groupId>
  		<artifactId>device-library</artifactId>
  		<version>18.3.1</version>
  	</dependency>


Other dependencies (e.g. the org.json parser / object creator and derby db) that come 
with the client libraries are available in the main Maven repository on the internet, so 
we don't need to worry about those
