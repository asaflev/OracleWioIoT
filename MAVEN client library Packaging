The device-library.jar file comes from Oracle, but it's not available via Maven.
So we need to add it to the local Maven repository to enable the runtime to locate it.
You need to download the device library for the versio of the IOT Cloud service you are using.
To add it into the local Maven remo (Usualy in $HOME/.m2/repository) run the following command
CLEARLY YOU NEED TO ADJUST BASED ON THE ACTUAL VERSIONS, PATHNAMES ETC.

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=<group-id> \
        -DartifactId=<artifact-id> -Dversion=<version> -Dpackaging=<packaging>
    
For example (this is the device-library, but the enterprise-library will also need to be added for projects which use it)

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=$HOME/Downloads/iotcs/18.3.1/csl/javase/lib/device-library.jar  -Dpackaging=jar -DgroupId=com.oracle.iot.client \
        -DartifactId=device-library -Dversion=18.3.1
        
There also needs to be a dependency in the pom.xml file (that shoudl be in place, but the version number may need updating

  	<dependency>
  		<groupId>com.oracle.iot.client</groupId>
  		<artifactId>device-library</artifactId>
  		<version>18.3.1</version>
  	</dependency>


Other dependencies (e.g. the org.json parser / object creator and derby db) that come 
with the client libraries are available in the main Maven repository on the internet, so 
we don't need to worry about those
